OneRing
=======


[**One Ring**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Ring) to find them. I always want to know where are my kids and need to unmute and find my wife phone (better then the other way around :-). 

And wanted simple app that I could trust 
> - "**1ring**"
	> simple single fixed **trigger word**
> - Private
	>  Choosing **Contacts phone numbers** (>=1) which are permitted and would ignore all other.
> - escalation 
	subsequent trigger less then 1 minute apart
	> 1. once - query for location & Opens the app.
	> 1. twice - unmute the phone and takes it out of the "Do not disturb"
	> 1. third - set ring volume to max.
